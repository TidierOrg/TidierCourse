`Tidier.jl` is a package for analyzing tabular data inspired by R's tidyverse and crafted specifically for Julia. `Tidier.jl` is a *meta-package* in that its functionality comes from a series of smaller packages. Installing and using `Tidier.jl` brings the combined functionality of each of these packages to your fingertips.

Here are the packages that make up the Tidier-verse.

- `TidierData.jl`: for transforming, aggregating, and reshaping dataframes
- `TidierDB.jl`: like `TidierData` but for databases
- `TidierPlots.jl`: for plotting data
- `TidierCats.jl`: for working with categorical variables
- `TidierDates.jl`: for working with dates
- `TidierFiles.jl`: for reading files
- `TidierIteration.jl`: for iterating over collections
- `TidierStrings.jl`: for working with strings
- `TidierText.jl`: for working with text
- `TidierVest.jl`: for harvesting (scraping) website data

If you are new to the Tidier ecosystem, the number of packages can seem overwhelming. The good news is that for most analyses, you won't need to use functionality from all of the underlying packages.

If you are new to Julia, this guide will walk you through each aspect of the data analysis lifecycle for tabular data. In doing so, you will be introduced to each of the packages so that you can understand the scope and role of each package in the ecosystem. Even if you are a seasoned Julia programmer, this guide will help you figure out when to reach for `Tidier.jl` when other tools may be perfectly adequate.

# When should I reach for `Tidier.jl`?

The answer depends on if you are new to data analysis in Julia, or if you are an experienced Julia user.

!!! green "For new users"

	`Tidier.jl` provides a concise, consistent, and feature-complete set of tools for reading, writing, analyzing, and plotting tabular data. Because it is feature-complete, you can generally learn the `Tidier` way of doing things in Julia and have that serve as your mental model when performing data analysis. You may get the most value out of learning `TidierData.jl` and `TidierPlots.jl` for analyzing and plotting data frames as these implement a consistent domain-specific language across these two important domains, namely analysis and plotting.

!!! info "For experienced users"

	If you are already comfortable with `DataFrames.jl` (or one of its macro-based interfaces) and/or a plotting library, then learning the domain-specific language of `TidierData.jl` and `TidierPlots.jl` may not be as useful to you. The main advantage of learning `TidierData.jl` for experienced users is that the same syntax can be used to analyze databases (via `TidierDB.jl`). On the other hand, you may find many of the convenience functions within some of the smaller sub-packages like `TidierFiles.jl` (for reading/writing tabular files) and `TidierDates.jl` (for parsing dates) to be useful and time-saving.

# How do I get started with `Tidier.jl`?


If you are a new user, you will be best-served by installing and using the `Tidier` meta-package directly.

## Installing Tidier for the first time

To install Tidier, launch Julia and type the following into the console.

```
]add Tidier
```

Note that pressing `]` launches the package console, where the command `add Tidier` can be used to install Tidier. Another way to install Tidier is to type the following into the Julia console:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("Tidier")
```

This will install the latest version, with a few exceptions. If you already have an older version of Tidier installed, this will leave the older version installed. If you are working in Google Colab, this may install an older version of Tidier.

To check which version of Tidier is installed, you can check that status of the Tidier package like this:

```
]st Tidier
```

You can also use the following code, which will show you the version of Tidier with which this course was last updated:
"""

# ╔═╡ a328abfc-8742-48ec-a938-861096d57390
md"""

## Installing a specific package version

If you want to install a specific version of Tidier (e.g., 1.6.0), then you can use the following syntax in the package console:

```
]add Tidier@1.6.0
```

## Updating Tidier

If you have an older version of Tidier, you can also update it to the latest version within the package syntax.

```
]up Tidier
```

## Loading Tidier into your namespace

If Tidier will be your mainstay package for data analysis, then our recommended practice is to bring all of its exported functions and macros into your namespace using the following code:

```julia
using Tidier
```

!!! info "For experienced users"

	Experienced users may be wary of bringing all of the package functions and macros into the namespace in case of potential conflicts with other packages. For example, the `@select` macro in TidierData has the same name as the `@select` macro in DataFramesMeta, which can introduce conflicts.

	There are two alternatives for experienced users. The first is to use `import` rather than `using` so that all functions/macros need to be prefixed with `Tidier`, such as `Tidier.@select()`.

	```julia
	import Tidier
	```

	However, the second (and our recommended) practice for advanced users is to use or import the specific package(s) within the ecosystem rather than installing and using the Tidier meta-package. Loading specific packages (such as TidierDB) has the advantage of making installation a bit faster while reducing the dependency size.

	The main downsides of relying on specific packages (such as TidierData and TidierPlots) is that you may need to manage package versions yourself (e.g., TidierPlots may need to updated before TidierData because TidierPlots depends on TidierData). Using the Tidier meta-package ensures that package versions remain updated and consistent with one another. The other downside to using individual packages (particularly TidierData and TidierDB) is that you will need to manually disambiguate which function or macro you are referring to when they have the same name (e.g., `TidierData.@select` versus `TidierDB.@select`). When you use `Tidier`, it automatically handles this ambiguity. You can use `@select`, and it will all the appropriate macro depending on the data type.

## Downloading the MITRE Synthea dataset

The Synthea dataset is collection of datasets containing multiple comma-separated value (`.csv`) files. Each file has multiple columns and rows. The columns represent variables specific to the focus of the data file, and the rows represent individual observations. The meaning of rows differs across data files. For example, in the `patients` data file, each row represents a single patient, whereas each row represents a medication in the `medications` dataset.

Note that in the `patients` data frame, each row represents a patient. We can infer this by the fact that the `Id` values, presumably the patient identifiers, look unique on initial glance.

## Cleaning up the column names

You may also notice that there are subtle inconsistencies in the column names, which are quite common in data analysis. One inconsistency is that `Id` has a capital letter followed by a lower case letter, whereas `SSN` (another identifier) has all capital letters. Another inconsistency is that `BIRTHDATE` and `DEATHDATE` are single words, whereas `HEALTHCARE_COVERAGE` has two words separated by underscores. Another common issue that arises is that column names may contain spaces, which also can be inconvenient.

One way to standardize the column names is to use the `@clean_names` macro.

!!! info "Best practice: Cleaning the column names with `@clean_names`"

	After reading in a file, standardizing the column names using `@clean_names` should be considered a best practice. In this course, we will nearly always start by applying `@clean_names` anytime a new dataset is loaded. Its use is optional but recommended.

No. The `meds_clean` data frame only captures patients who are taking at least one medication. The clue is that the minimum number of active medications in the `meds_clean_count` data frame was `1`. Surely there must be patients who take no medications.

To evaluate this, let's join the `patients_clean` data frame with `meds_clean_count` and examine the `num_meds` column. If all patients in the `patients_clean` data frame are also represented in the `meds_clean_count` data frame, then there should be no missing values for `num_meds`.

While most patients in this dataset are taking at least one medication, `348` patients have a `missing` value for `num_meds` after joining the two datasets, which means that they are not on medications.

## Answer: Doing the math correctly

To correctly calculate the mean, we have to replace these missing values with zeros because a `missing` value for `num_meds` means that patients do not take medications. If we are to calculate the average number of medications, then we need to correctly account for patients not taking medications (i.e., counting these zeros for `num_meds`).

We will add a `@count(num_meds)` at the end of the chain to confirm that the `missing` values were correctly replaced with zeros.

	In previous code, we have always started a chain with the syntax `@chain df begin`, where `df` represents a data frame. You can alternatively begin a chain with `@chain begin`, which is especially handy when the initial value is lengthy to type, such as when starting a chain with a `@left_join`.
