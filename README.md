Welcome to the **Tidier Course**, an interactive course designed to introduce you to Julia and the Tidier.jl ecosystem for data analysis. The course consists of a series of Pluto Notebooks so that you can both learn and practice how to write Julia code through real data science examples.

This course assumes a basic level of familiarity with programming but does not assume any prior knowledge of Julia. This course emphasizes the parts of Julia required to read in, explore, and analyze data. Because this course is primarily oriented around data science, many important aspects of Julia will *not* be covered in this course.

This course is currently under construction. Check back for updated content.
