# The verbs of data science

There are 5 verbs which enable you to do 80% of all analyses that can be done using a single data frame. We refer to them as verbs because they change some aspect of our dataset, and once we familiarize ourselves with their purpose, we can start using them in sentences... as verbs.

These 5 verbs are:

* `@select`: for selecting columns
* `@mutate`: for creating new columns or modifying existing ones
* `@summarize` or `@summarise`: for summarizing multiple rows into a single row
* `@slice`: for slicing rows based on row number
* `@filter`: for filtering *in* rows based on criteria

Each of these verbs take a data frame as the first argument. For example, selecting the county column can be done as follows.

# ╔═╡ fbb1ba79-0c17-4d5b-8c8a-ecf1c9e426dc
md"""
## Chaining verbs

Because each of these verbs takes a data frame as the first argument, these verbs are readily structured into a pipeline (or chain) using the `@chain` macro. When using the `@chain` macro, each expression's result is inserted into the first argument of te following one.

So if we wanted to lowercase the string after selecting the `county`, we would naturally express this as a pipeline starting with `@select` followed by `@mutate`.

This chain is easily expressed as a sentence:

* Start with the `patients` data frame
* Select the `county` column
* Mutate the `county` column to be lower case string values.

You may see examples of other code online where people choose to express this without a `@chain` like this: `@mutate(@select(patients, county), county = str_to_lower(county))`.

While this produces the same result, it is much less readable since you have to read it from the inside out, rather than from left-to-right.

## Tidy expressions

Experienced Julia users may scratch their heads when seeing the expression `@mutate(county = str_to_lower(county))` for several reasons. First, they wonder why `county`, which refers to a column in the dataset, is written as `county` rather than as `:county`, which is a favored design choice of other macro-based data analysis packages. The use of `county` as a bare variable name is referred to within the Tidier ecosytem as a **tidy expression**.

The reason why `Tidier.jl` uses tidy expressions is that they are concise and also allow for multiple columns to be referred to via a unit-range-like style.

md"""
This naturally leads to questions about how scoping works within `Tidier.jl` and how to refer to variables outside of data frames. One helpful way to think about scope within `Tidier.jl` is that by default, bare varables (like `county`) operate in "data frame scope," where we assume by default that they refer to columns within a data frame.

To refer to variables outside of the data frame, we have to use interpolation.
"""

# ╔═╡ 522804b5-9cfc-40b1-a8db-700b8f6dba90
md"""
## Interpolation to refer to variables outside of the data frame

`Tidier.jl` supports two forms of interpolation: `!!` (or "bang-bang") interpolation and `@eval`-based interpolation. While you can read more about bang-bang interpolation in the TidierData.jl documentation, we currently recommend `@eval`-based interpolation because it is uniformly supported across macros in the `Tidier.jl` ecosystem. The reliance on `@eval` comes with a slight performance penalty, which is why we are continuing to work on improving support for bang-bang interpolation.

Let's say we had a variable `county` countaining the value "LOS ANGELES", and we wanted to update the `county` column in the `patients` data frame to refer to a lowercased version of the `county` variable.

## Auto-vectorization

Going back to the `@mutate(county = str_to_lower(county))` expression, experienced users may also wonder with the function is written as `str_to_lower(county)` rather than `str_to_lower.(county)`. Usually, adding a period to the end of a function call "vectorizes" it so that it runs on vectors (i.e., columns of data) rather than on single values.

`Tidier.jl` performs auto-vectorization, such that the function call is actually converted to `str_to_lower.(county)` before it is run. TidierData contains a lookup table of functions that are not to be vectorized -- all other function calls are vectorized by default.

If you knew that `str_to_lower` should be vectorized, you could choose to vectorize it within TidierData. However, we generally discourage vectorizing expressions (unless you need to override a default setting not to vectorize a given function) because letting `Tidier.jl` handle vectorization enables the use of consistent syntax when working with data frame (with TidierData) and databases (with TidierDB).

The default settings can be overridden. If you do *not* want a function to be vectorized, you can prefix the function call with a `~`, such as `~str_to_lower(county)`. In this case, that would produce an error because `str_to_lower` operates on scalars and relies on being vectorized to operate on columns of data.

`@select` is used for selecting columns. Within the Tidier.jl ecosystem, it can also be used to modify columns that are being selected. `@select` supports a number of different syntaxes.

Before we use select columns, let's glimpse the `patients` data frame to remind ourselves of the column names.

## Modifying columns during selection

## Selecting and modifying multiple columns

What if we wanted to apply a transformation to multiple columns while selecting them? We could rely on the `across()` function, which only works inside `Tidier.jl` macros.

Two things to note:
1. We prefixed the string within `starts_with` with an `r` to denote that this string is a regular expression.
2. We had to add a `.` to `str_to_lower` to indicate the need to vectorize `str_to_lower` to work on the column (a vector). This is because `across()` does not perform auto-vectorization. Thus, the `across()` syntax can also be a helpful way to specific complex vectorization patterns.

`@mutate` supports a similar style of coding as `@select`. However, unlike `@select`, `@mutate` leaves in all of the columns. For readability purposes only, we will follow `@mutate` expressions with `@select` expressions to narrow the columns, recognizing that in many cases, we could have achieved the same result with `@select` alone if limiting the column names was a requirement.

# `@filter` for filtering in rows based on criteria

The last "basic" verb we will learn in this lesson is `@filter`, which allows rows to be subset based on criteria.

### A simple example

Let's say we wanted to limit our dataset to rows where a person is still alive (their death date is missing), they go by a "Ms." or "Mrs." prefix, and they have a birthday in July.

Here's how we would achieve that:
"""

md"""
!!! info "Let's break down some details"

	There a couple of Tidier-specific things to notice here. First, TidierData's auto-vectorization means that `ismissing()` is being converted to `ismissing.()`, and `&&` is being converted to `.&&` so that these operations are vectorized. In general, `&&` is preferred for `@filter` over `&` because `&&` is a shortcut operator -- the second condition is only evaluated if if the first is `true`.

	Second, `prefix in ("Ms.", "Mrs")` is being converted behind the scenes into `in.(prefix, Ref(Set("Ms.", "Mrs.")))` before being run in Julia. This allows you to write a very compact syntax or `in`, and the rationale for this specific conversion is that it is more performant approach for large datasets.

	Third, you'll notice we didn't need to type in `using Dates` to access the `month()` function. That is because TidierDates provides a number of helper functions to handle dates, and TidierDates also re-exports the Dates package. This is part of the batteries-included Tidier philosophy.

# Grouping to apply data verbs by group

Now that you've learned the 5 "basic" data verbs, and how to chain them together using `@chain`, the last thing to learn before mastering basic exploratory data analysis is grouping, which is achieved using the `@group_by` macro. 

All of the above macros respect grouping assignments made by `@group_by`, so if you are running into unusual behavior, it's often because you're data are grouped differently than you expected.

!!! info "Important grouping behavior to know"

	In `Tidier.jl`, `@group_by` applies one ore more grouping columns to the data frame, producing a `GroupedDataFrame`.

	Using `@summarize` peels off one layer of grouping. Other transformations **do not** remove grouping. If you were grouped by one column, then applying `@summarize` will result in an ungrouped data frame. If you were grouped by two or more columns, then the result will be a grouped data frame with the last layer of grouping removed.

	You can always manually ungroup by calling `@ungroup`, which will remove all grouping. Calling `@group_by` on an already-grouped data frame will overwrite the grouping with the new grouping columns.

# Summary

In this section, we learned about the 5 common single-data frame verbs that help accomplish 80% of exploratory data analysis work.

* `@select`: for selecting columns
* `@mutate`: for creating new columns or modifying existing ones
* `@summarize` or `@summarise`: for summarizing multiple rows into a single row
* `@slice`: for slicing rows based on row number
* `@filter`: for filtering *in* rows based on criteria

We learned how to set groups and do each of these operations separately for each group, using `@group_by` and `@ungroup`.

We also learned about a number of other compound verbs or shortcuts, including

* `@slice_head`, `@slice_tail`, `@slice_sample`, `@slice_max`, and `@slice_min`
* `@count`
* `@arrange`

And we learned how to chain these operations together using `@chain`.
