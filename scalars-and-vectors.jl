## Scalars
In Julia, an individual value is referred to as a "scalar", and a collection of values is referred to as a "vector". Scalars are a type of data structure, not a data type. As a result, scalars can refer to individual values that are *either* numbers, strings, or dates (among other types).

### Numbers as scalars

Let's explore different types of scalars by doing some simple math.

Let's multiply 2 and 3.

Multiplying 2 and 3 results in the number `6`, which is probably what you expected. Now, let's check the type to see what type of data this is.

The data type is a 64-bit integer, which is a type of scalar.

Does multiplying 2 and 3 always result in 6? Not always. In Julia, if 2 and 3 refer to strings, then multiplying them results in the number 23.

### Strings as scalars

For example, let's repeat the same multiplication but this time represent 2 and 3 as strings.

So far, this is fairly straightforward. Behind the scenes, the `*` operator has a way of handling numbers, and a separate way of handling strings.

We won't dig into the details of exactly how this works yet, but it is worth knowing that there's nothing special about `*` in Julia. We refer to the `*` symbol as an operator because it operates on the items to either side of it (for example, on a `2` and `3`). But in every other way, it's defined and behaves like every other function.

For example, we can write `2 * 3` as `*(2, 3)`, thereby calling `*` like we would call any other function.

### Our first error!

!!! danger "Don't panic!"
	This error message is expected!

	We get an error when we try to multiply a string by a number. If you look carefully at the first line of the error message, Julia tells you it doesn't know how to multiply a string by an integer. Unlike many other dynamically typed programming languages (like R), Julia will not automatically convert types between strings and numbers.

What if we multiply `2` (an integer) with `3.0` (a floating point number)?

Julia handles this situation just fine, with the caveat that it converts the result to a 64-point floating point number rather than an integer.

If we indicate that `2.0` and `3.0` are float values by adding a decimal point, then Julia will identify the data type as a `Vector{Float64}`. Note that the zero is optional, so `[2., 3.]` would have the same result.

### String vectors

Defining a string vector is as easy as ensuring that each value in the vector is a string. If we are typing out the values of the string (known as a "string literal"), then we can accomplish this by surrounding the value with double-quotations (`""`).

Importantly, single-quotations are used to denote individual characters of a string, so `"2"` is not the same thing as `'2'` in Julia. Specifically, strings in Julia are considered to be collections of characters.

### Mixed data type vectors

We saw that when combining an integer with a float, the resulting data type was a `Float64` because the integer was upgraded to a float.

The parameter in `Vector` does not always get upgraded when we combine different data types. For example, if we combine a `"2"` (a string) with a `3` (an integer), then the resulting type is `Any`, which is an abstract data type that encompasses all other types.

You might be wondering what exactly `Any` represents here. `Any` is the "overall" data type for the vector. In other words, all bets are off with respect to data types when it comes to adding, removing, or modifying elements of this vector.

Even though the overall data type of the vector is `Any`, the individual elements of the vector still retain their data types. We can see this by evaluating the `typeof()` function on each individual value of the `["2", 3]` vector.

## Dot-vectorization

To run the `typeof()` function separately to each element of the vector, you *might* be tempted to write a loop that will let you apply this function separately to each element of the vector.

But there's no need!


!!! note
	In Julia, running a function on each element of a vector is easily accomplished by adding a period (`.`) to the end of the function call. This is referred to as dot-vectorization and is essentially a bit of compiler *magic*.

By dot-vectorizing the `typeof()` function, we were able to run it individually on each item of the vector. It returns two values, one for the data type for each of the elements.

!!! note
	Dot-vectorization is a powerful tool because it lets us apply *any* function individually to the elements of *any* collection! The person defining the function does not have to do anything special to enable dot-vectorization. It is built into Julia for all functions!

In this particular example, we had the option to call `typeof()` or `typeof.()`. Both of these were valid Julia code, although they produced different results. However, sometimes, only the dot-vectorized version is valid. This is true when it comes to performing common arithmetic operations on vectors.

	This error was expected! Why?

	The error occurs because we tried to add a vector to a scalar. Julia knows how to add scalars to one another but doesn't know how to add a vector to a scalar. If you look carefully at the first line of the error, Julia even tells you that there is `no method matching +(::Vector{Int64}, ::Int64)`. This means that for the `+` function, Julia doesn't know how to add a `::Vector{Int64}` to an `::Int64`. Double-colon signs in Julia are used to refer to data types.

Since Julia *does* know how to add scalars to one another, we can have Julia individually add the scalars `2` and `3` to the scalar `1`. How do we accomplish this? Dot-vectorization!

### How to dot-vectorize operators

!!! note
	When applying dot-vectorization to operators, we place the `.` *before* the name of the function. Operators are special types of functions that can be inserted in between their arguments, such as the `+` operator in `a + b` resulting in `a .+ b`.

Let's revisit the error above for a moment. The error stated `MethodError: no method matching +(::Vector{Int64}, ::Int64)`. The first time (or even the tenth time) you see this error, it can be quite disconcerting. 

There's no need to worry when you see this error. Method errors are quite common in Julia because of the heavy reliance of Julia on the programming paradigm of "multiple dispatch". This means that functions like `+` and `*` have been separately defined for different types of arguments. When Julia comes across a combination of arguments for which it doesn't have a function defined, it results in a `MethodError`.

This usually means one of the following things:

- You forgot to dot-vectorize the function (as in the example above).
- You forgot to load a package that defines how to interact with data types you are working with.
- You made a mistake.

Let's take a look at a situations where we made a mistake. Even though Julia knows how to multiple numbers with one another and strings with one another, trying to multiply a string by a number results in a `MethodError` because Julia doesn't have a method defined for this.

# Summary

In this module, we learned about scalars, vectors, and dot-vectorization. Scalars refer to individual values, which can be any type of data such as an integer, float, string, date, or one of many more data types. Vectors typically contain collections of scalars, where the individual scalars may be any data type (or even more than one data type).

Many functions in Julia are designed to operate on scalars, such as `a + b`, `a * b`, and `typeof(a)`. We can apply these functions to vectors by using *dot-vectorization*, rewriting them as `a .+ b`, `a .* b`, and `typeof.(a)`, respectively.

Many functions can be validly called in their usual or dot-vectorized form, and it is typically left up to you to specify in the intended form. This is one area where Tidier.jl can help by intelligently handling the vectorization for you to reduce common errors involving vectorization.
